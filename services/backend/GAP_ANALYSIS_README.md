# SEC Compliance Gap Analysis System

This system performs comprehensive gap analysis between company 10-K filings and SEC compliance requirements, generating actionable findings and tasks.

## Features

### üîç Gap Analysis Engine
- Compares Orion 10-K data against LLM organized compliance requirements
- Identifies gaps in financial reporting, risk disclosures, governance, and controls
- Generates detailed findings with severity levels and business impact assessment

### üìã Findings Generation
- **Simple Findings**: Direct analysis using OpenAI GPT-4
- **Chunked Findings**: Processes large datasets by breaking them into manageable chunks
- **Deduplication**: Removes duplicate findings based on title similarity
- **Priority Scoring**: Assigns priority levels (1-5) and severity ratings

### üìù Task Generation
- Creates actionable tasks from findings
- Includes effort estimates, dependencies, and responsible parties
- Generates project timelines and resource allocation recommendations

### ü§ñ OpenAI Integration
- Uses GPT-4 for intelligent analysis and findings generation
- Implements chunking for large datasets
- Provides fallback mechanisms for API failures

## API Endpoints

- `POST /test-analysis/run-findings-test` - Test findings generation
- `GET /test-analysis/analysis-status` - Get system status

## Usage Examples

### 1. Run Comprehensive Analysis
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/gap-analysis/comprehensive-analysis"
```

### 2. Get Analysis Results
```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/gap-analysis/analysis-summary/{analysis_id}"
```

### 3. Test the System
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/test-analysis/run-gap-analysis"
```

## Data Flow

1. **Load Orion 10-K Data**: Reads the synthetic Orion 10-K JSON file
2. **Load Compliance Requirements**: Retrieves organized requirements from database
3. **Perform Gap Analysis**: Compares company data against requirements
4. **Generate Findings**: Creates detailed findings using OpenAI
5. **Generate Tasks**: Creates actionable tasks from findings
6. **Store Results**: Saves analysis results to database

## Key Components

### GapAnalysisEngine
- Main engine for performing gap analysis
- Integrates with OpenAI for intelligent analysis
- Handles fallback scenarios

### SimpleFindingsGenerator
- Generates findings using chunking approach
- Implements deduplication logic
- Provides both simple and chunked analysis

### ComprehensiveAnalysisEngine
- Orchestrates the entire analysis process
- Combines results from multiple approaches
- Generates comprehensive summaries and recommendations

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Required for OpenAI integration
- `DATABASE_URL`: Database connection string

### Chunking Configuration
- Default chunk size: 1000 characters
- Configurable chunk size for different data types
- Automatic sub-chunking for large sections

## Database Schema

### GapAnalysis Table
- Stores analysis results and metadata
- Links to findings and tasks
- Tracks compliance scores

### GapFinding Table
- Individual findings with severity and priority
- Links to analysis and requirements
- Tracks status and updates

### GapTask Table
- Actionable tasks derived from findings
- Includes dependencies and effort estimates
- Tracks assignment and progress

## Error Handling

- Graceful fallback when OpenAI API fails
- Comprehensive error logging
- User-friendly error messages
- Automatic retry mechanisms

## Performance Considerations

- Chunking reduces memory usage for large datasets
- Async processing for better performance
- Caching of analysis results
- Efficient deduplication algorithms

## Testing

Run the test script to verify functionality:
```bash
python test_gap_analysis.py
```

This will test:
- Basic gap analysis
- Simple findings generation
- Chunked findings generation
- Comprehensive analysis
- Specific findings on financial and risk data
